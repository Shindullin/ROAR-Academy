When a function includes a list of arguments, it is allowed that the code also declare a default value when no value is provided when the function is called in the code. The first line of printed results indicates this case, when *L, S = func_test()* does not provide the argument values, and the default values of *L = ['a', 'b']* and *S = 'ab'* are used. \n","2. It may come as a surprise that while the same function is called the second time in the same fashion, the returned values of *L* and *S* are different from the first time. This is because an important rule defined in Python regarding the type of an input argument to be mutable or immutable:\n","    * When an argument type is immutable, then its default value will be reset to the one listed in the function definition. In the above example, *S = 'ab'* is immutable string type. Therefore, when its input value is not provided by the function call, the default value is always used.\n","    * When an argument type is mutable, then its default value will be set only once based on the value in the function definition. Subsequently, the default value of a mutable argument remains the same from the last time the function is called. In the above example, when the function is first called, the mutable argument *L* has changed its value to ['a', 'b', 'c']. Therefore, when the function is called the second time without explicit setting the argument value, the default value of *L* is the same value from the last function call. Adding another 'c' to this value will return the result ['a', 'b', 'c', 'c'].\n","   * The third line of printed result illustrates the situation that when a mutable argument is changed inside a function, the modified value is carried over to the outside of the function regardless if the value is part of the function output. However, when an immutable argument is modified inside a function, it is not carried over to change the variable value outside the function. This conclusion makes sense because when the function executes the statement *S = S + 'c'*, the assigned new string *S* is a local string object that has different memory address and ID than the string *S* of the same name outside the function. \n","   \n","   \n","In conclusion, when arguments are passed into a function, mutable variables share the same objects inside and outside the function, while immutable variables do not share the same objects. As a result, changes on immutable variables inside a function do not change the variables of the same names outside. Such immutable variables inside a function are called local variables.\n","\n","Contrast to local variables, Python also defines a keyword called *global* to define global variables. When a variable is declared as global, then Python will force all variables of the same name to share the same object and memory address. Consequently, changing the value of a global variable in one place will affect all the other places in the code when the same variable is used.

Please code a timer function called tic_toc(). The first time calling the function, it will be set in the TIC state, calling time.time() to save the current system clock time; The second time calling the function, it will then be set in the TOC state, returning the time difference between the current system clock time and the previously saved system clock time. After the TOC state return, the function will be reset to wait for the next TIC state function call. Hint: The saved system clock time and the function's state whether it is in the first tic state or the second toc state can be defined as global variables. \n","\n","2. Please code a circular_shift() function, which takes in two arguments: a string called *input_string* and an integer called *direction*. When *direction = -1*, the function will return a string that circularly shifts *input_string* elements to the left by one position. When *direction = 1*, the function will return a string that circularly shifts *input_string* elements to the right by one position. Hint: In here, circular shift means whenever an element is shifted outside the range of the existing string, it will be added back to the string from the opposite side such that the total length and all elements remain the same after circular shift."]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30042,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":false,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.19"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
